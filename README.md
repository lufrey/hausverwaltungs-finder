# ApartiFind Project

ApartiFind gathers near real-time data about available apartments in Berlin, straight from the real estate management websites. While it's near impossible to find affordable housing, we try declutter and present the listings as soon as they go online.

## We need your help

There are too many real estate managements for the two of us to go through by ourselves. Your help is greatly appreciated if you are able to add a few sites.
